# SnapIt Java

This is a Java high-fi mockup version of the SnapIt photography app. 
It provides timers and a sound mode for triggering a camera from the 
computer using the Triggertrap dongle, available at http://shop.triggertrap.com/

## Usage

This application is intended for those who have an interest in the Snap_it API on
a non Windows platform and can serve as a demo of the features available in the
SnapIt app on the Windows Phone SDK 8.0 platform.
